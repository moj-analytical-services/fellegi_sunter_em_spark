# The Fellegi-Sunter model

Splink implements the Fellegi-Sunter model for probabilistic record linkage. This topic guide is intended to give a high-level introduction to the model. If you aren't familiar with the concept probabilistic record linkage, it is recommended to read that [topic guide](./probabilistic_vs_deterministic.md) first.

## Parameters of the Fellegi-Sunter model

The Fellegi-Sunter model has three main parameters that need to be considered to generate a match probability between two records:

!!! note ""
    * $\lambda$ - probability that any two records match 
    * $m$ - probability of a given observation *given* the records are a match
    * $u$ - probability of a given observation *given* the records are **not** a match

<hr>

### λ probability

The lambda ($\lambda$) parameter is the prior probability that any two records match. I.e. assuming no other knowledge of the data, how likely is a match? Or, as a formula:

$$
\lambda = Pr(\textsf{Records match})
$$

This is the same for all records comparisons, but is highly dependent on:

* The total number of records  
* The number of duplicate records (more duplicates increases $\lambda$)  
* The overlap between datasets  
    * Two datasets covering the same cohort (high overlap, high $\lambda$)
    * Two entirely independent datasets (low overlap, low $\lambda$)

<hr>

### m probability

The $m$ probability is the probability of a given observation *given the records are a match*. Or, as a formula:

$$
m = Pr(\textsf{Observation | Records match})
$$

For example, consider the the $m$ probability of a match on Date of Birth (DOB). For two records that are a match, what is the probability that:

- **DOB is the same**:
  - Almost 100%, say 98% $\Longrightarrow m \approx 0.98$
- **DOB is different**:
  - Maybe a 2% chance of a data error? $\Longrightarrow m \approx 0.02$

The $m$ probability is largely a measure of data quality - if DOB is poorly collected, it may only match exactly for 50% of true matches.

<hr>

### u probability

The $u$ probability is the probability of a given observation *given the records are **not** a match*. Or, as a formula:

$$
u = Pr(\textsf{Observation | Records do not match})
$$

For example, consider the the $u$ probability of a match on Surname. For two records that are not a match, what is the probability that:

- **Surname is the same**:
  - Depending on the surname, <1%? $\Longrightarrow u \approx 0.005$
- **Surname is different**:
  - Almost 100% $\Longrightarrow u \approx 0.995$

The $u$ probability is a measure of coincidence. As there are so many possible surnames, the chance of sharing the same surname with a randomly-selected person is small.

<hr>

## Interpreting m and u

In the case of a perfect unique identifier:

* A person is only assigned one such value - $m = 1$ (match) or $m=0$ (non-match)  
* A value is only ever assigned to one person - $u = 0$ (match) or $u = 1$ (non-match)

Where $m$ and $u$ deviate from these ideals can usually be intuitively explained:

!!! question ""
    ### _m_ probability
    A measure of **data quality/reliability**.

    How often might a person's information change legitimately or through data error? 

    * **Names**: typos, aliases, nicknames, middle names, married names etc.
    * **DOB**: typos, estimates (e.g. 1st Jan YYYY where date not known)
    * **Address**: formatting issues, moving house, multiple addresses, temporary addresses

!!! bug ""
    ### _u_ probability
    A measure of **coincidence/cardinality**[^1].

    How many different people might share a given identifier?

    * **DOB** (high cardinality) – for a flat age distribution spanning ~30 years, there are ~10,000 DOBs (0.01% chance of a match)
    * **Sex** (low cardinality) – only 2 potential values (~50% chance of a match)

[^1]: 
    Cardinality is the the number of items in a set. In record linkage, cardinality refers to the number of possible values a feature could have.
    This is important in record linkage, as the number of possible options for e.g. date of birth has a significant impact on the amount of evidence that a match on date of birth provides for two records being a match.

<hr>

## Match Weights

One of the key measures of evidence of a match between records is the match weight. 

### Deriving Match Weights from m and u

The match weight is a measure of the relative size of $m$ and $u$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    M &= \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \log_2 K \\[10pt]
    &= \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \log_2 m - \log_2 u
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the probability that two random records match and $K=m/u$ is the Bayes factor.

A key assumption of the Fellegi Sunter model is that observations from different column/comparisons are independent of one another. This means that the Bayes factor for two records is the products of the Bayes factor for each column/comparison:

$$ K_\textsf{features} = K_\textsf{forename} \cdot K_\textsf{surname} \cdot K_\textsf{dob} \cdot K_\textsf{city} \cdot K_\textsf{email} $$

This, in turn, means that match weights are additive:

$$ M_\textsf{obs} = M_\textsf{prior} + M_\textsf{features} $$

where $M_\textsf{prior} = \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right)$ and
$M_\textsf{features} = M_\textsf{forename} + M_\textsf{surname} + M_\textsf{dob} + M_\textsf{city} + M_\textsf{email}$.

So, considering these properties, the total _match weight_ for two observed records can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    M_\textsf{obs} &= \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \sum_{i}^\textsf{features}\log_2(\frac{m_i}{u_i}) \\[10pt]
    &= \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \log_2\left(\prod_i^\textsf{features}\frac{m_i}{u_i}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$


### Interpreting Match Weights

The _match weight_ is the central metric showing the amount of evidence of a match is provided by each of the features in a model.  
The is most easily shown through Splink's Waterfall Chart:

![](../../img/fellegi_sunter/waterfall.png)

- 1️⃣ are the two records being compared
- 2️⃣ is the _match weight_ of the **prior**, $M_\textsf{prior} = \log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right)$.
  This is the _match weight_ if no additional knowledge of features is taken into account, and can be thought of as similar to the y-intercept in a simple regression.

- 3️⃣ are the _match weights_ of **each feature**, $M_\textsf{forename}$, $M_\textsf{surname}$, $M_\textsf{dob}$, $M_\textsf{city}$ and $M_\textsf{email}$ respectively.
- 4️⃣ is the **total** _match weight_ for two observed records, combining 2️⃣ and 3️⃣:
    
    $$ 
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        M_\textsf{obs} &= M_\textsf{prior} + M_\textsf{forename} + M_\textsf{surname} + M_\textsf{dob} + M_\textsf{city} + M_\textsf{email} \\[10pt]
         &= -6.67 + 4.74 + 6.49 - 1.97 - 1.12 + 8.00 \\[10pt]
         &= 9.48
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    $$

- 5️⃣ is an axis representing the $\textsf{match weight} = \log_2(\textsf{Bayes factor})$)

- 6️⃣ is an axis representing the equivalent _match probability_ (noting the non-linear scale). For more on the relationship between _match weight_ and _probability_, see the [sections below](#understanding-the-relationship-between-match-probability-and-match-weight)

## Match Probability

_Match probability_ is a more intuitive measure of similarity than _match weight_, and is, generally, used when choosing a similarity threshold for record matching.

### Deriving Match Probability from Match Weight

Probability of two records being a match can be derived from the total _match weight_:

$$
Pr(\textsf{Match | Observation}) = \frac{2^{M_\textsf{obs}}}{1+2^{M_\textsf{obs}}}
$$

???+ example "Example"
    Consider the example in the [Interpreting Match Weights](#interpreting-match-weights) section. 
    The total _match weight_, $M_\textsf{obs} = 9.48$. Therefore,

    $$ Pr(\textsf{Match | Observation}) = \frac{2^{9.48}}{1+2^{9.48}} \approx 0.999 $$

#### Understanding the relationship between Match Probability and Match Weight

It can be helpful to build up some intuition for how _match weight_ translates into _match probability_. 

Plotting _match probability_ versus _match weight_ gives the following chart:

![](../../img/fellegi_sunter/prob_v_weight.png)

Some observations from this chart:

* $\textsf{Match weight} = 0 \Longrightarrow \textsf{Match probability} = 0.5$
* $\textsf{Match weight} = 2 \Longrightarrow \textsf{Match probability} = 0.8$ 
* $\textsf{Match weight} = 3 \Longrightarrow \textsf{Match probability} = 0.9$ 
* $\textsf{Match weight} = 4 \Longrightarrow \textsf{Match probability} = 0.95$ 
* $\textsf{Match weight} = 7 \Longrightarrow \textsf{Match probability} = 0.99$ 

So, the impact of any additional _match weight_ on _match probability_ gets smaller as the total _match weight_ increases. This makes intuitive sense as, when comparing two records, after you already have a lot of evidence/features indicating a match, adding more evidence/features will not have much of an impact on the probability of a match.

Similarly, if you already have a lot of negative evidence/features indicating a match, adding more evidence/features will not have much of an impact on the probability of a match.

### Deriving Match Probability from m and u

Given the definitions for _match probability_ and _match weight_ above, we can rewrite the probability in terms of $m$ and $u$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Pr(\textsf{Match | Observation}) &= \frac{2^{\log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \log_2\left(\prod_{i}^\textsf{features}\frac{m_{i}}{u_{i}}\right)}}{1+2^{\log_2\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right) + \log_2\left(\prod_{i}^\textsf{features}\frac{m_{i}}{u_{i}}\right)}} \\[20pt]
 &= \frac{\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right)\prod_{i}^\textsf{features}\frac{m_{i}}{u_{i}}}{1+\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right)\prod_{i}^\textsf{features}\frac{m_{i}}{u_{i}}} \\[20pt]
 &= 1 - \left[1+\left(\frac{\lambda}{1-\lambda}\right)\prod_{i}^\textsf{features}\frac{m_{i}}{u_{i}}\right]^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
